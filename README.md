Here’s a structured `README.md` file with Docker setup instructions for your "Opossum Search" web app:

```markdown
# Opossum Search Web App

Opossum Search is a simple web app that redirects search queries to Google with the word "opossum" added to it. The app is visually similar to Google, featuring an opossum image as the logo and a footer stating "Powered by opossum search."

## Features:
- Redirects search queries to Google, appending "opossum" to the query.
- A Google-like interface with an opossum image as the logo.
- A footer with the text "Powered by opossum search."
- A single HTML file with embedded CSS and JS.

## Docker Setup Instructions

To run the Opossum Search web app inside a Docker container locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system.

### 1. Clone the repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opossum-search.git
cd opossum-search
```

### 2. Create a `Dockerfile`

In the root directory of your project, create a `Dockerfile` to define the environment for your app.



### 3. Build the Docker image

Build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t opossum-search .
```

### 4. Run the Docker container

Run the Docker container, mapping port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on your local machine:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 opossum-search
```

### 5. Access the app

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the Opossum Search web app with the opossum image logo, the search bar, and the footer message.

### 6. Stop the Docker container

To stop the Docker container when you're done, run:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter "ancestor=opossum-search")
```

## Project Structure

The project is designed to be a simple, self-contained web app. Here’s the folder structure:

```
opossum-search/
├── Dockerfile
└── Index.html
```

- `Index.html`: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web app.
- `Dockerfile`: Used to create a Docker image to serve the app.



### Key points:
- **Dockerfile**: It uses Nginx to serve the HTML file.
- **Instructions**: It includes steps to build and run the Docker container.
- **Single HTML file**: All HTML, CSS, and JS are contained within `Index.html`.
